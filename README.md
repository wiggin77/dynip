"Dynamic DNS service is used to keep a domain name pointing to the same computer or server connected to the Internet despite the fact that the address (IP address) of the computer keeps changing. This service is useful to anyone who wants to operate a server (web server, mail server, ftp server, irc server etc) connected to the Internet with a dynamic IP or for someone who wants to connect to an office computer or server from a remote location with software such as pcAnywhere."
